# ðŸŽ¼ Chord2SVG
### by **Carlos Mauro @ CMG Solutions**

**Chord2SVG** is a high-efficiency, algorithmic system for generating chords in **staff notation** using SVG rendering.  
It provides a **consistent**, **automated**, and **optimization-driven** approach to batch music engraving.

By directly computing optimal notehead and accidental positions through mathematical and recursive layout logic, **Chord2SVG** achieves engraving-level precision at a fraction of the complexity â€” ideal for composers, developers, or researchers who want consistent notation output without relying on heavyweight GUI-based software.

## ðŸš€ Key Advantages

### âš¡ Efficiency Through Optimization
- Fully algorithmic rendering pipeline with no manual dragging or correction.
- Iterative collision detection, layout fanning, and recursive backfill passes ensure **compact, visually balanced results**.
- Optimized for **batch or programmatic generation** â€” render hundreds of chords with consistent spacing in milliseconds.

### ðŸ’¡ Independence from Commercial Notation Software
- No need for Finale, Sibelius, Dorico, or MuseScore.
- Works purely through **SVG computation**, allowing integration with custom software, websites, or research tools.
- Enables flexible, code-based control over notation rules and layout aesthetics.

## ðŸŽµ Core Features

### ðŸŽ¶ Notehead Placement Engine
- Dynamically adjusts **horizontal offsets** based on step distance.
- Prevents collisions in dense chords.
- Works across **treble**, **bass**, and **alto** clefs with accurate staff calibration.

### â™¯ Advanced Accidental Placement
- **Iterative Fanning Algorithm**
  - Distributes accidentals leftward in clusters based on vertical proximity (Î”step < 6).

- **Recursive Backpropagation Fill**
  - Reclaims available columns after fanning, optimizing layout compactness.
  - Prevents over-fanning and keeps spacing consistent across registers.
- **Multi-column Backfill Optimization**
  - Scans all possible columns from right to left to find the nearest valid position.
